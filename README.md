## Notes

I had trouble understand IBOutlets and Buttons but I watched videos on how to create an array of buttons which worked out for me. I also had uses creating mock data but I just redid the lab and able to pull code from there and able to create a new mock data. Overall this is a challenging project but I learned so much about Swift and Xcode
